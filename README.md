# TION App : The Internet’s Own News App 

> ###  _TION App is WEB3 News Network  providing the News which you can trust!_

## The problem TION App solves

**The issue with current News System :**
It is pretty obvious that corporate Media is dying. Not many people watch or trust the mainstream media which is showcased on TV or other news platforms.  But these big media companies can still force feed us a specified news content by making it artificially ranked high on news and social media platforms. Further they can also instill means which will make it hard for the normal public to report bad content.

**So to tackle this issue :**
We thought of creating an entirely decentralized news system network, where journalists can upload news content like articles, photos and videos. This incentivises good journalism and eliminates the possibility of a top-down propaganda machine. 
Hence, Journalism Wins! Consumer Wins! 

## INSPIRATION
Have you ever heard about Julian Assange, Aaron Swartz or Edward Snowden?
Do you know what is common between all of them? 
If you have heard about them or any of them then you must be knowing that all were a kind of hacktivist and were involved in some sort of hacktivism in bringing out some important confidential information to the public by internet leaks. So right now any platform on which such internet leaks are posted would be taken down immediately but if it’s uploaded to our platform nothing of such sorts would happen because everything is stored on the blockchain and nothing can be taken down. The chain can never be tracked or hacked. Nobody can track or threaten the person who's sharing the truth!


### Challenges we ran into 
- Verify the authenticity of news 
- Writing smart contracts
- Adding the feature of Upvote and Downvote 
- Making the UI which could serve our purpose and making it look attractive to the user 


### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Putting the news network on blockchain
- Making a working prototype of our idea and Creating a news blogging platform in 48hrs 
- Upvoting feature on blockchain 
- Getting an opportunity and taste of working on the web3 using IPFS and Polygon Ethereum smart contracts

### How did we make this? 
- Entire news content on IPFS. The Headline, Content, Images everything is stored and retrieved through IPFS. 
- Smart Contracts for upvoting articles as well. 
- Deployed all smart contracts on Polygon Matic Mumbai TestNet
